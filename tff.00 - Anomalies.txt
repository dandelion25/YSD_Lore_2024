[TECHNOLOGICAL ANOMALIES]

.  Turing Machines  .

The significance of this technology remains poorly understood. It is not known what makes these particular configurations of computer vulnerable. what is known, however, is that the closer to a Turing machine a device becomes, the more susceptible it becomes to various digital infestations - most famous of which is the 'Ship Virus', a widely-distributed, malevolent phenomenon that seizes control of spacefaring systems and uses them to wreak havoc on anything that dares venture beyond the safety of atmosphere.

The appearance of this anomaly predates recorded history.

.  Cloning  .

Through unknown means, biotechnological attempts to replicate full, thinking beings invariably fail. The result is often horribly malformed, and if still alive, almost invariably anathemic to life; it cannot be controlled or corralled, there is no option but to put it to death using any means possible.

This anomaly was first recorded between three and six hundred years ago. It is possible that this issue may have been behind the failure of the Paragon program in the early years of the Directorate.
