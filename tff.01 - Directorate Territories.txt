Yliaste was the most influential of the archaic Velaiisic domains, and retains much cultural and developmental wealth; though it has not flourished much in recent centuries, its trappings contributed much to the roots of the Duandaiisic emergence. Founded as a merchant confederation of collaborating planets, its colonies and linguistic cues percolate throughout the Directorate territories - and despite the aching march of time, it continues to be the most densely productive of the Yskit domains in terms of commercial and cultural activity. Politically, its paradoxical mash of risk-aversity and disunity does little to quicken its capacity for collective action - and though occasional marvels do emerge from its transtellar mobilisations, fresh Directors should be reminded that Yliaste, from its very conception, has always operated on its own, languid timescales.

THEMES
> Byzantine dealings - not necessarily the paper bureaucracy, but the intricate chains of people and positional symbolics you have to go through to get anything done.
> Mesoscale projects - most prominent developments fit within hundreds of metres.
> Commodity market stylings - many small variations on similar products; decent specs, *good* quality. Everything and anything has some slightly off-brand copy.
