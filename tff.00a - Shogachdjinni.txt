[construct: 소갓djinn: little hat ghost]

A Shogachdjinn is a vessel of triumph and suffering, a commemoration of the narrative immortalized in its tangles. It demands acknowledgement, bending the will of those around it to conform to its reality. It is the eternal prison and manifestation of the Sublimated, echoes of the Idols doomed to fragmentation, deconceptualisation, and death. The webs of subspace warp in its presence, inhaled and exhaled through the scarred tangle of its didactic breath to carry out a dead will - yet without a conscious mind to tether it, it cannot latch onto the threads of realspace.

The process of devotion demands a difficult balance: the mind and all its associations must remain intact, yet the devotee must also fully process the disconnected hyperdimensional impulses of a Shogachdjinn. Centuries of advancement have streamlined the operation, but it is by no means a comfortable one. The surgery is extremely invasive, leaving little of the skull in place - and while adaptive tuning systems lessen their strain over time, the crude subspace interfaces available to the Consolidation are prone to transducing sharp, agonizing pulses of subspace interference. All the while, the devotee must confront their ultimate fate: slow, progressive oblivion.

To devote oneself to a Shogach is to relenquish the self: the self becomes a reflection of the pure, and the pure self melds with the echoes of the Idol. Bit by bit, the personality of the devotee flakes away - but before they become fully abstracted, they are able to both consciously and unconsciously join with and manipulate nanocomplete processes and intelligences. One must take particular caution; improperly isolated, a sleeping devotee can cause significant amounts of damage through their dreams alone - or in the case of late-stage Idolisation, the uncontrolled manifestations of their Shogach's unfiltered narratives.
