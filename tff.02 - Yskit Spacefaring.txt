the YSD uses a variety of spacefaring designs, owing to their diverse technological base; divided into two classes: Relics, based on fragments and reconstructions of LoB/AEGIS wrecks, and oneirotech patterns - vast, slow-cruising hulks capable of traversing vast distances in subspace.

---   RELICS

Relic patterns tend to be more combat-capable compared to their oneirotech cousins, but are more costly to maintain and are often incapable of independent subspace traversal; the materials for their construction are also difficult to source in the Yskit region, making Relic patterns consist a comparatively small portion of the YSD fleet. Intact AEGIS vessels and ship-sections in particular are prized for their powerful, nanotech-integrated systems; with suitable fuel in limited supply, however, they are often retrofitted into ship-cores and nexi for larger, indigenously-designed battleships and dreadnoughts.

i say a truth: the sky is blue - i hear that the sky is blue and i respond accordingly.
i will color the sky red with a paintbrush, because red is a better colour.

Combat in the depths of subspace - even within the relatively well-mapped reaches of the known hyperlanes - is not something to be attempted lightly. It requires an immense amount of planning, preparation, and stealth: to exactly predict the transit of targets in subspace, align one's own force for a suitable intercept, avoid detection to prevent easy escape through the infinite expanse of subspace, and most demandingly, to possess good fortune enough to avoid being swept away by a stray current.
