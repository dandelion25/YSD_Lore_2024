== PAUM -- [Panopticon Ascendant Universal Machine]
PAUMs represent the pinnacle of Directorate technological prowess, elongated combining the best parts of relic technology and oneirotech; linked to attendant Directors via cybernetic subspace relays not unlike that of an Idol, it consists of a vast assembly of quantum-analog predictors and communications equipment capable of observing, interpreting, and even counteracting subspace signals and oneirotech interactions across vast distances. In the hands of a skilled administrator, it is the ultimate tool for oversight - in a nanotechnological war against infection and decay, it is the bare necessity.

The precursor to the PAUM - the subspace pylon - was created in the era of Velaiisin, the product of a collective effort to unlock use of Shogachdjinni without resorting to the costly practice of Devotion. Though ultimately a failed endeavour, the intersection of relic-tech quantum transduction and Lus oneirotechnology opened the way to the development of subspace pylons: self-sustaining spatial oscillations precisely superimposed over quantum-phased physical structures, forming an object capable of spanning multiple dimensions. At the time, they were merely curiosities - great in both cost and size, ill-suited for practical use as subspace gates or signal beacons; the concept did not gather significant interest until after the founding of the Directorate.

The construction of a PAUM is a hugely costly affair, requiring massive amounts of opthal thread and exotic reinforcements to prevent subspace currents from tearing apart the structure and its inhabitants. Once anchored, however, it can be relocated through subspace itself without overdue strain - untethering itself from realspace and setting itself adrift through the effort (and effective expenditure) of integrated idols, until it either encounters an exit or is successfully intercepted and towed back to realspace by an oneirotech Directorate tug.

The PAUM is a powerful tool for control - and while not fully proof against interference, the unique engineering of the PAUM and its integrated idols allows for a variety of responses to be employed against subversions and infections. Outside data filters through a chain of four shogachdjinni prior to transduction into chambers containing computational components and data shuttles; these in turn are cycled in and out of subspace along the PAUM during operation as part of a mechanically-phased system to efficiently separate, isolate, and identify source signals and influences while partially shielding them from hyperdimensional intervention.
