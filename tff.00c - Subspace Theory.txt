.  NOMAK's COMMANDMENTS  .
So to in no particularly order answer some of these questions, since i gave it a big thought:
black holes and white holes have a type of subspace distortion that id call contingent, or the existence of it exists between both planes simultaneously, however more notably they cause an effect that is similar to that of a "natural" "subspace anchor" (which furthermore, i should create an article on the wiki all about at some point) BUT essentially, what this means, is that it "folds" the fabric of subspace, creating a level of consistency that pierces through each of them, making it a consistent object across all of the folds of it, natural in this case meaning that it is something non artificial that already creates this distortion.

It essentially acts as a funnel, in a similar way a black hole does, but it immediately affects all of the folds of subspace around it, essentially creating a consistent event horizon that acts the same within all 4-dimensional space, and this would likely cause a tug and pull effect as well; do keep in mind, not all black holes do go through into subspace, but most of them will be able to be co-existent with their realspace and subspace counterparts, imagine the hole is opened on both sides, if you will.

As for hyperspace though, the veins shift fairly consistently, and usually form around black holes and such, there may be a slight pull effect, but it's reasonable to believe that at least part of what gives it its pull is the natural formations and dilations caused by black holes and the shifting of the universe over time as well, so although you can argue a hyperspace lane might be pulled by black holes, it wouldn't cause a circumstance where it would "pull" someone out of it as they pass it, it's more like they're going around the black holes almost every single time


.  Yskit Pylon Thoughts [20240108]  .

the problem i have is that the concept of a pylon is something which intersects realspace and subspace to a degree; it's similar in concept to the idea of simulating black holes with metamaterials, and they require immense amounts of energy just to not collapse - actively maintained, instead of being in a semi-stable state like a black hole would be at the bottom of a 'dimensional well' (randomly wordmade) 
[21:04]mjeiouws: i need to mesh it somehow, and i am unsure
[21:06]mjeiouws: and the way i explained it is similar in geometry, except instead of using gravity to bend subspace over continuous lengths it uses artifact-derived material to effectively occlude it in localised cages after joining a subspace and realspace component and linking them together 
[21:09]mjeiouws: if they are in fact similar in behaviour, a panopticon unit (of which there are a small number, and they are relatively tiny in terms of scale) effectively acts as a tiny-ass subspace portal
which now that i think about it was essentially always the case, and i'm not sure how to deal with that
[21:09]mjeiouws: and now that i mention it
i really wanna have it
[21:11]mjeiouws: it'd also probably have literal waves being made by the arrival of a directorate panopticon in a certain location, which is cool, if putting something of a damper on any hope of covert operation
[21:12]mjeiouws: blargh
[21:13]mjeiouws: (which i think i was counting on because of the idea that while a pylon / panopticon would probably significantly disrupt local subspace, basically nobody would have the capability to actually pinpoint it over large scale 'cuz of how fucky subspace is)
[21:13]mjeiouws: which
hm
hmmmmm
no that feels like a happy medium
[21:13]mjeiouws: and also i've had two cups of coffee after abstaining for far too long help
