[Technology :: Oneirotech mechanisms]
The use of integrated oneirotechnology is widespread across the Directorate. From charging cells to amplifiers and even guidance systems, oneirotech components have found their way inside everything from pistols to anti-ship munitions - exploiting the uncanny awareness of the Shogachdjinni to make possible things that would typically induce catastrophic failure in mundane, Yskit-designed components. The work of Idols, inflexible in nature, remains less sophisticated than even relic technologies of AEGIS and League origin; this is more than made up for in sheer, overwhelming power.

With the need to maintain active connection to a relevant Idol, oneirotech remains limited: physical bandwidth ultimately constrains the rapidity of narrative development within most components, and the difficulty of coordinating and decrypting multiple Shogachdjinni precludes cost-effective construction and use of compound oneirotechnology on the scale of personal weapons. Yet with sufficient investment, compromises can be made: a machine fitted with relic quantum-analog transducers can, with the necessary incantations, bring to bear much greater amounts of focus from even the most distant of Idols.
